###

<h2 align="center">
ESP32 Integration: Designed and implemented a traffic light simulation system using ESP32 microcontrollers.
</h2>
###
<h2 align="center">
Vehicle Detection: Utilized CCTV images and contour line analysis for real-time vehicle detection and traffic monitoring.
</h2>
###
<h2 align="center">
Adaptive Timing: Developed an adaptive timing algorithm to adjust signal durations based on traffic volume, improving traffic flow efficiency.
</h2>
###
<h2 align="center">
Global Lock Mechanism: Created a global lock system to balance signal timings at intersections, preventing any single signal from monopolizing green light phases and ensuring equitable traffic management.

ESP32 and Arduino IDE

Driver Installation: The <a href="https://github.com/RahZero0/Smart-Automation/blob/main/CP210x_Universal_Windows_Driver.zip" style="color: lightblue;">Driver</a> is essential for running the ESP32 script on your system.

Pin Voltage Information: ESP32 GPIO pins typically operate at 3.3V. Some pins may provide slightly higher voltages, which can damage sensitive components like LEDs.

Voltage Risks: Using incorrect voltage levels can cause component failure. For example, using a higher voltage pin blew up one of my trial bulbs.
